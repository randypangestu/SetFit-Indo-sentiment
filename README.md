# Efficient Indo-sentiment with Few Shot Learning and Distillation
Indonesia sentiment analysis using SetFit model for Few shot learning
This project contains code and data for training and evaluating machine learning models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as well as code for deploying the trained models for inference.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy 1.20 or higher
- Pandas 0.25 or higher
- scikit-learn 0.22 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher (if using the PyTorch models)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```
https://github.com/randypangestu/efficient-Indo-sentiment.git
```


2. Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models, run:
```
python train_and_eval.py

```

To run inference on new data, use the `infer.py` script:
```
python infer.py --input_data path/to/input.txt --output_file path/to/output.txt

```

## Data

The data for this project is stored in the `data` directory. The `train` and `test` subdirectories contain the training and test sets, respectively.

## Models

The trained models and any necessary files for deploying the models are stored in the `models` directory.

## Results

The results of the training and evaluation are stored in the `results` directory.

## Documentation

Additional documentation and notes on the design and implementation of the project can be found in the `documentation` directory.
